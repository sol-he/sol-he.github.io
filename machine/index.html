    Mathematical problems, or puzzles, are important to real mathematics 
    (like solving real-life problems), 
    just as fables, stories, and anecdotes are important 
    to the young in understanding real life. â€• Terence Tao, Solving Mathematical Problems: A Personal Perspective

    As a student doing mathematics, I sometimes find it confusing to read solutions
    where some of the ideas/gadgets used in the proof seem like they're constructed
    out-of-thin-air. Therefore, more importantly than accumulating problem-solving 
    patterns/tricks/gadgets is to gain insights to what leads to those 
    patterns/tricks/gadgets. In an attempt to document these insights from my own studies, 
    I compiled a collection of problems and one of the many progressions of solving them.
    The superscripts in the text indicate which "moral of the story" is applied.

    Sometimes math seems like magic. Some combination of theorems or tricks 
    can alchemize a humble calculator into an intelligent computer.
