    Mathematical problems, or puzzles, are important to real mathematics 
    (like solving real-life problems), 
    just as fables, stories, and anecdotes are important 
    to the young in understanding real life. â€• Terence Tao, Solving Mathematical Problems: A Personal Perspective
  </small></i>

    As a student doing mathematics, I sometimes find it confusing to read solutions
    where some of the ideas/gadgets used in the proof seem like they're constructed
    out-of-thin-air. Therefore, more importantly than accumulating problem-solving 
    patterns/tricks/gadgets is to gain insights to what leads to those 
    patterns/tricks/gadgets. In an attempt to document these insights from my own studies, 
    I compiled a collection of problems and one of the many progressions of solving them.
    The superscripts in the text indicate which "moral of the story" is applied.

    Sometimes math seems like magic. Some combination of theorems or tricks 
    can alchemize a scattered pile of gibberish into surprising results. While I admire 
    the elegance of proofs like this, I also enjoy the insights obtained 
    from working out a low-level proof. To document problems with both high-level and
    low-level proofs from my own studies, I compiled a collection of these problems and their 
    the solutions.
