			<p>
				I adopted my name "Sol" when my high school Spanish teacher
				asked us to pick a Spanish name for the class. Sol means the sun 
				in Spanish, and I love sunshine and nature. The video on the home 
				page was taken in the Hulunbuir Grassland. I aspire to herd sheep
				and horses there. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In my free time, I like to walk in neighborhoods and look
				at houses. My other hobbies include playing frisbee, singing, 
				salsa dancing, playing the recorder, and laying around.
