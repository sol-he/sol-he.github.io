				I adopted my name "Sol" when my high school Spanish teacher
				asked us to pick a Spanish name for the class. Sol means the sun 
				in Spanish, and I love sunshine and nature. The video on the "sheep" 
				page was taken in the Hulunbuir Grassland. In an alternate world, 
				I would be herding sheep
				and horses there. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In my free time, I like to walk or run in neighborhoods and admire houses. 
				My ongoing effort is in trying to perfect a push up and to do a pull up and a handstand. 
				(If you have advice, please share!)
				My other hobbies include playing frisbee,
				singing, poker, building lego sets, salsa dancing, playing the recorder and piano.
