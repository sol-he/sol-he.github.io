		<p> In high school, I dreamt of becoming a concert pianist for the beauty 
			of music and its ability to communicate abstractly.
			 However, somehow I wandered into math, drawn to it by its creative reasoning, its purity, and a desire to understand
				a subject so vast and deep. 
			I studied music at Brandeis University for a year before transferring to
			Carnegie Mellon University as a math major. In my undergrad, I dabbled in 
			programming in order to get a job after graduation. Fortunately, 
			the day before Thanksgiving in my senior year, 
			a professor encouraged me to realize that I still 
			prefer math over other career choices. Now I'm a graduate student at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
