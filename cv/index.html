			<summary>Story</summary>
			In high school, I dreamt of becoming a concert pianist for the beauty 
			of music as an abstract form of communication.
			 Later, I wandered into math, drawn by its creative reasoning and purity.
			I studied music at Brandeis University for a year before transferring to
			Carnegie Mellon University as a math major. In my undergrad, I dabbled in 
			programming and planned to get a programming job after graduation. 
			Fortunately, the day before Thanksgiving in my senior year, 
			a professor encouraged me to realize that I still 
			prefer studying math over other career choices. Now I'm a graduate student at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
