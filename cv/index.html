		<p> I dreamt of becoming a concert pianist and somehow wandered into math. 
			I studied music at Brandeis University for a year before transferring to
			Carnegie Mellon University as a math major. In my undergrad, I did some 
			programming on the side in order to get a job after graduation. Fortunately, 
			the day before Thanksgiving in my senior year, 
			a professor encouraged me to realize that I still 
			prefer math over other career choices. Now I'm a graduate student at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
